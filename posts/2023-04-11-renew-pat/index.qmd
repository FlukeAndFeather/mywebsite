1.  Generate a new token by calling `usethis::create_github_token()` from your R console (e.g., in RStudio). This launches GitHub in your browser. Sign in if necessary.
2.  You should be at the "New personal access token" page. Change the **Note** to "RSTUDIO" or something similar. I like to set the Expiration to 90 days. Don't change any of the check boxes. Scroll to the bottom and click the green "Generate token" button.\

    1.  If you get an error saying "Note has already been taken", call your token something else, like RSTUDIO2.
3.  You should now see your list of tokens. The top one should be highlighted in green and look like a long string of random characters. Copy the whole thing using the copy icon just to the right of it.
    1.  If you encountered the error in step 2, use this opportunity to delete your expired "RSTUDIO" token.
4.  Back to RStudio. Again at the console, call `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`. Notice you don't give the function call any arguments, just hit enter.\

5.  You should see a prompt asking what to do with your current credentials. Choose "Replace these credentials".
6.  Paste your token at the "Enter new password or token" prompt and hit enter.

That should do it!
