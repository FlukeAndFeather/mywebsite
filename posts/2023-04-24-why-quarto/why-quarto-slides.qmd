## Why Quarto?

I barely wrapped my head around R Markdown. Now I have to learn something new?

## It's just friendlier

-   Backwards compatible (most everything you learned still works)

-   Consistent syntax (smooths over some weird R Markdown bumps)

-   Multi-language support (if that applies to you in the future)

## Context: *literate programming*

-   Combine text, code, and outputs (figures etc). Great for scientific analysis!

-   Useful for all stages of the scientific analysis pipeline

    -   Exploratory analysis (with collaborators!)

    -   Technical writing (like cross-references and citations!)

    -   Science communication (websites and more!)

## Exploratory analysis (with collaborators!)

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
Project structure:

-   A [GitHub repo](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather/antwincomm)

-   A directory of Quarto documents

-   A [landing page](https://flukeandfeather.github.io/antwincomm/)

## Exploratory analysis (with collaborators!)

::: columns
::: column
### Park downhill

-   You're going to take breaks

-   Quarto keeps your notes, code, and figures in sync

-   Jump back in faster!
:::

::: column
### Productive 1-on-1 and team meetings

-   Send an email with links to updates

-   Keep progress in context

-   More in depth feedback, better planning

## Communicating your science (technical writing)

::: columns
::: column
-   Create a figure in code

-   Give it a name e.g., `fig-regression`

-   Cross-reference it with `@fig-regression`

-   Quarto turns it into @fig-regression
:::

::: column
```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-regression
#| fig-cap: y is correlated with x, isn't that swell?
#| echo: fenced

set.seed(1057)
dat <- tibble(
  x = runif(25),
  y = 3 * x + 1 + rnorm(25)
)
ggplot(dat, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x) +
  theme_classic()
```

## Communicating your science (references)

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Look up the DOI

-   Use RStudio crossref lookup

-   Turn [`@10.3389/fphys.2022.917976`]{style="font-size: 1.5rem;"}

-   Into @czapanskiy2022

## Bonus!

-   [Make a personal website](https://cmhale98.github.io/) to showcase your research

-   [Or a course website](https://allisonpayne.github.io/queerecologies/) for your teaching portfolio

-   [Excellent tutorial by Samantha Csik](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)
